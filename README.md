# lab_project

Me and my friend (PHLS) started this project so I can practice how to code.
The idea of the project is to build a software that helps me in my current work (paternity testing in a genetic laboratory).

Accomplishments:
- Most of the laboratory procedures are already modelled;
- Data input (subject genotypes) is working;
- Lab cases are automatically processed:
  - Subjects are checked for potential swap between samples;
  - Lab case is classified according to type (trio, duo or complex);
  - Potential mutations are identified;
  - Paternity inclusion or exclusion is identified.

The main next step is to add paternity calculations. More details are described in "TODO.txt" file.
